                <p style=text-align:center;"><u><b>BANNER HEALTH HISTORY</p></b></u>
                <p>In 1999, two nonprofit entities Samaritan Health System (dating back to 1911) and Lutheran Health Systems (history dating back to 1938) merged, forming Banner Health. At the time the entity operated in 14 states and had around 22,000 employees.</p>
                <p>In 2005, Banner closed the former Mesa Lutheran hospital and later converted it to office space at a cost of around $100 million.
                <p>In 2006 Banner Health launched a telemedicine program. The health system determined the telemonitoring saved 34,000 ICU days and close to 2,000 lives in 2013 based on APACHE II predicted length of stay and mortality rates.</p>
                <p>In October 2006 Banner acquires the assets and staff, including 40 providers of Big Thompson Medical Medical Group in Loveland, Colorado.</p>
                <p>In 2008, Banner Health selected Nextgen Healthcare as its partner for ambulatory EHR medical records at all of its outpatient facilities.</p>
                <p>In October 2008, Banner acquired large specialty group "Arizona Medical Clinic" in the west valley and renamed this entity Banner Arizona Medical Clinic.</p>
                <p>In August 2012, Banner embarked on a plan to rename and harmonize the names of its acquired medical clinics organized under Banner Medical Group. Clinics were renamed according to specialty across the entire system.</p>
